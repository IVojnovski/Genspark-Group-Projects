When loading projects from challenges make the java folder the Source folder in the Project Structure-Modules section
(Should also mark test folder to take tests in the same Modules section and Import the JUnit 5 library so there aren't any problems)
And make the out folder the location of the compiler output in Project Structure - Project section
